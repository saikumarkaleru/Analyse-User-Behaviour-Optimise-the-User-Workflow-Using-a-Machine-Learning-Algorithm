## Description
I have created an e-commerce website using Html,css,javascript,bootstrap then deployed into Netfly Platform . 
It contains various webpages such as home, store, account, about,
contact us. There are various features like product details, add to cart, search product .
I have applied user guiding tool named WalkMe that will guide a new user through orderly
steps on my website to use it in the most simple way to buy a product. I have integrated my
website to Google Analytics Platform. This tool is able to track the users action
and the time spent by the users on the various actions of the website. I have accumulated the
analytics data from various users and stored it. I have collected data of around 75 users with
various data points such as time spent by users on the different pages on website, filters being
used by the users , time spent by users on particular product page, etc. Then, Fitting the Markov
Chain model gives us the transition probabilities matrices and the lambda parameters of the chain
for each one of the three lags along with the Start and End Probabilities.
